# Debugging (& Testing)

# The `add_evens()` function and main code that makes use of it has been hastily written by a careless programmer, and now it's up to you to fix this mess.

# Use your intuition and expertise to debug the code:
# - WHAT is the code supposed to do?
# - HOW did the programmer intend to make this happen?
# - What does the code ACTUALLY do?
# - How can you change what the code CURRENTLY does to make it do what it SHOULD?
# - What sort of testing will you do to ENSURE that the code behaves as expected?

# When you have fixed the code, update the `tests.md` file to include the tests that you used to ensure the code works.  Feel free to add as many tests as you need.

# # 1) What is the code SUPPOSED to do?
# # 2) What does the code ACTUALLY do?
# # 3) How do I go from ACTUALLY to SUPPOSED?
# # :(
# # :/
# # 4) Use print() to output a behind-the-scenes look at variable values
# # 5) Trim the problem down
# # 6) Comment out, don't delete until your're done

# Commenting----------------------------------------------------
# Anything after a # is a comment, and will be ignored

# This will not run

# Print---------------------------------------------------

# # use print() to make text appear in the console

# # print(Hello world)
# print('Hey.')

# Variables-----------------------------------------
# # use variables to store & reference values

# our_class = 'ICS3U'
# print(our_class)

# our_class = 'Computer Studies'

# print(our_class)

# Variable names------------------------------------------

# # variables should be written in lowercase, with underscores between words
# # this is often referred to as "snakecase"
# # variables should be descriptive of their purpose

# teacher_name = 'Mr McKinley Evans'
# print(teacher_name)

# Variable Types-----------------------------------------

# # variables come in different types
# # mostly, you'll use integers, floats, and strings

# some_int = 12345
# some_float = 12345.6789
# some_str = '12345'

# print(type(some_int))
# print(type(some_float))
# print(type(some_str))

# product = some_int * some_float
# print(type(product))

# Input--------------------------------------------

# # use input() to collect input from the user
# # use input('Some text') to give the user a prompt before getting their input

# user_text = input('Enter some text > ')

# print(user_text)

# Operators------------------------------------------

# We use operators to make two values or variables interact with each other

# # assignment 
# my_variable = 1234

# # math
# sum = 2 + 2
# product = 2 * 2
# exponent = 2 ** 2
# division = 4 / 2

# # what is the remainder from division?
# modulus = 5 % 2 

# # divide, then round down
# floor_division = 5 // 2

# # comparison
# greater = 3 > 2
# less_than = 2 < 3
# greater_or_equal = 3 >= 2
# less_or_equal = 2 <= 3
# equal = 2 == 3
# not_equal = 2 != 3

# Conditionals (if/elif/else)----------------------------------------

# # Conditionals, or if-statements let us choose whether or not to execute a block of code

# if 3 < 2:
#   print('Sometimes')
#   print('More code')
# elif 4 > 5:
#   print('Something else')
# else:
#   print('Catch all')

# print('All the time')

# Recursion (while)------------------------------------------

# # We use a loop when we want to run the same code over and over again
# # A "while loop" will run repeatedly as long as its opening condition is true

# letters = 'i'
# while letters != 'iiiii':
#   print (letters)
#   letters = letters + 'i'
  

# Recursion with break-------------------------------------------

# # use break to get out of the loop early
# counter = 0

# early = input('Number to stop early: ')

# while counter < 10:
#   print(counter)
#   if counter == int(early):
#     break
#   counter = counter + 1

# print('I am done counting')

# Lists----------------------------------------

# # Lists (often casually called arrays) let us hold a set of values in a single variable
# # We use [ ] to show an array

# dogs = ['Carl', 'Tony', 'Etta', 'Carl']
# print(dogs)
# print(type(dogs))
# print(len(dogs))
# print(dogs[0])
# print(dogs[1])
# print(dogs[2])
